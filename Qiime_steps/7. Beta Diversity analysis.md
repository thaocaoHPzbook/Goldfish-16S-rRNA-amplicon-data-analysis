## 1. Bray-Curtis Index
This index is used to measure the difference between two microbial communities. The value ranges from 0 to 1:
    0 means the two communities are completely identical.
    1 means the two communities are completely different.
This index helps us understand the level of difference in microbial species between samples.
**PCoA Plot**
```bash
qiime diversity pcoa \
  --i-distance-matrix core-metrics-results/bray_curtis_distance_matrix.qza \
  --o-pcoa core-metrics-results/bray_curtis_pcoa_results.qza
```
```bash
qiime emperor plot \
  --i-pcoa core-metrics-results/bray_curtis_pcoa_results.qza \
  --m-metadata-file metadata.tsv \
  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/bray_curtis_emperor.qzv
```

The PCoA plot ([bray_curtis_emperor.qzv]) does not show clear clustering between the treatments,further PERMANOVA analysis for a more detailed examination and reveals significant differences in microbial communities across the groups.
**PERMANOVA analysis**
```bash
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
  --i-distance-matrix beta-diversity.qza \
  --m-metadata-file metadata.tsv \
  --m-metadata-column Treatment \
  --p-method permanova \
  --o-visualization bray_curtis_group_significance.qzv
```

With a p-value greater than 0.05, the conclusion is that there is no significant difference between the groups based on the Bray-Curtis index. This suggests that the treatments or groupings do not have a strong influence on the differences in microbial community structure between the groups.

## Jaccard index
Jaccard index is a measure of similarity between two sets. In microbiome studies, it is used to compare the presence or absence of species across different samples.
    Range: 0 to 1.
        0 means the samples have no species in common (completely different).
        1 means the samples have identical species (completely the same).
Jaccard index focuses on the presence/absence of species, rather than their abundance, making it useful for studies where the presence of specific species is more important than their relative abundance.
```bash
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
  --i-distance-matrix jaccard_distance_matrix.qza \
  --m-metadata-file metadata.tsv \
  --p-method permanova \
  --m-metadata-column Treatment \
  --o-visualization jaccard_permanova.qzv
```
[jaccard_permanova.qzv](https://github.com/thaocaoHPzbook/Goldfish-16S-rRNA-amplicon-data-analysis/blob/main/Qiime_steps/jaccard_permanova.qzv) is generated
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfbb646b-d7bd-45dd-8353-c7d7966b9bbd)
    p-value = 0.643: Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, this indicates that there is no significant difference in the microbial community structure between the Treatment groups.
    Test Statistic (pseudo-F) = 0.9941: This is the statistical value used to assess the difference between groups. However, the result is not strong enough to indicate a clear distinction, as reflected by the large p-value.    
**Conclusion:There is no significant differentiation between the Treatment groups in this dataset based on the Jaccard index and PERMANOVA analysis.**

## Weighted UniFrac 
Weighted UniFrac is better at detecting differences in community structure by considering the relative abundance of each species, not just whether or not they are present in a sample.
```bash
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
  --i-distance-matrix core-metrics-results/weighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \
  --m-metadata-file metadata.tsv \
  --p-method permanova \
  --m-metadata-column Treatment \
  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/weighted_unifrac_permanova.qzv
```
[weighted_unifrac_permanova.qzv](https://github.com/thaocaoHPzbook/Goldfish-16S-rRNA-amplicon-data-analysis/blob/main/Qiime_steps/weighted_unifrac_permanova.qzv) file is generated
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10ff8cc4-1869-47b7-bbbf-3a061383b80b)
    p-value = 0.484: The p-value is greater than 0.05, indicating that there is no significant difference in the microbial community structure between the treatment groups.
    Test Statistic (pseudo-F) = 0.9428: This value indicates the degree of separation between the groups. However, since the p-value is large, it suggests that the difference is not statistically significant.
**Conclusion: There is no significant difference in the microbial community structure between the treatment groups based on the Weighted UniFrac distance matrix and the PERMANOVA test.**

## Unweighted UniFrac
Unweighted UniFrac measures the differences between microbial communities based on the presence or absence of species, without considering their abundance or frequency. It is useful for comparing the community structure and detecting shifts in species diversity between samples, especially when the focus is not on the abundance of each species.
```bash
qiime diversity beta-group-significance \
  --i-distance-matrix unweighted_unifrac_distance_matrix.qza \
  --m-metadata-file metadata.tsv \
  --p-method permanova \
  --m-metadata-column Treatment \
  --o-visualization unweighted_unifrac_permanova.qzv
```
[unweighted_unifrac_permanova.qzv](https://github.com/thaocaoHPzbook/Goldfish-16S-rRNA-amplicon-data-analysis/blob/main/Qiime_steps/unweighted_unifrac_permanova.qzv) file is generated.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c264b117-059f-46da-b583-d43f1ea01df2)
    p-value = 0.662: Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, there is no significant difference in the microbial community structure between the groups based on the unweighted UniFrac distance.
    Test Statistic (pseudo-F) = 0.9676: This value indicates the variation between groups relative to the variation within groups. However, the result does not show a significant difference, as reflected by the high p-value.
**Conclusion: There is no significant difference in microbial community structure across the treatment groups based on the unweighted UniFrac distance, suggesting that the presence/absence of species is not strongly influenced by the treatments in this dataset.**
