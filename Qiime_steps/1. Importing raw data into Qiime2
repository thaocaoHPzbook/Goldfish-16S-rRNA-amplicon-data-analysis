## Generate manifest.csv
Sequence data are paired end in the format of FASTA with good quality score; therefore, in qiime2 the type will be "SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]" and their imput format asigned as PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33.
Before importing, [manifest.csv](https://github.com/thaocaoHPzbook/Goldfish-16S-rRNA-amplicon-data-analysis/blob/main/Qiime_steps/manifest.csv) file must be prepared.

 ```bash
qiime tools import \
  --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \
  --input-path manifest.csv \
  --output-path short_reads_demux.qza \
  --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33
```
This might take a while before you get the results. The output of this, is a .qza file that you have already specified it in the command, in this example demuxed-dss.qza. You can then create a visualized file from this artifact, with the following command:

```bash
qiime demux summarize \
  --i-data short_reads_demux.qza \
  --o-visualization short_reads_demux.qzv
```
This **short_reads_demux.qzv** is a visualized format of short_reads_demux.qza. which you can view it on {qiime2 viewer}(https://view.qiime2.org/)). Once you are there you can either drag-and-drop the artifact into the designated area or simpley copy the link to the artifact from this repository and paste it in the box file from the web. Once there, you must come across the following picture:

**Figure 1. Demultiplexed pairedEnd read**
On this overview page you can see counts of demultiplexed sequences for the entire samples for both forward and reverse reads, with min, median, mean and max and total counts.

**Figure 2. Interacvive plot for demultiplexed pairedEnd reads**
Understanding this plot is crucial for the denoising step, as you need to determine the truncation length for both forward and reverse reads in a way that ensures at least 50% of the reads have a quality score (Q) â‰¥ 30. You can observe these changes by hovering over the interactive box plots. In this case, the quality of both forward and reverse reads starts to decline significantly after approximately 220 nt.
