# Analysis of gut microbiota in Qiime2 and Rstudio/R.

## Workflow overview and output
(Insert the workflow)

## Quality check of raw reads

## Step in Qiime 2
### 1. Importing raw data into Qiime2

### 2. Filtering, dereplication, sample inference, chimera identification, and merging of paired-end reads by DADA2 package in qiime2

### 3. Training a primer-based region-specific classifier for taxonomic classification by Na√Øve-Bayes method

### 4. Creating a phylogenetic tree using align-to-tree-MAFFT-FastTree

### 5.  Rarefaction Analysis

### 6. Core Diversity Metrics Calculation

### 7. Alpha Diversity analysis 

### 8. Beta Diversity analysis

## Steps in R/Rstudio
### 1. Differential abundance analysis of taxa by ANCOMBC

### 2. Analysis of chemical biomarkers for gut microbiome: Heatmap correlation
